            <h1>About The Lip Lab</h1>
            <p>The Lip Lab was founded in 2025 by Favour, born from a simple realization: many lip products look good on the lips but don’t actually take care of them.
               What started as a small passion project quickly became a purpose-driven brand focused on creating lip products that combine beauty with real care. From day one, The Lip Lab set out to change the narrative — lip gloss shouldn’t just shine, lip moisturisers should actually moisturise, and lip brightening products should support healthy, natural lips.
               As the brand grew, so did the vision. There was a season of quiet growth — a time spent improving formulas, refining ideas, and raising standards behind the scenes. That pause wasn’t a setback; it was preparation.
               Today, The Lip Lab offers a growing range of lip glosses, lip moisturisers, and lip brightening products, thoughtfully created to nourish, protect, and enhance the lips. Every product is made with intention, quality, and the belief that lip care should be simple, effective, and confidence-boosting.
               The Lip Lab is more than a beauty brand —
               it’s a commitment to healthy, soft, and beautiful lips.</p>
